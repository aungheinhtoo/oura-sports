# Oura-sports

Welcome to oura sports, It's a personal sport portofolio project built with NextJS that comes with:

-   An "Adventure" editor which consists of merging photos, gpx activities, enriched text to create blog posts of biking trips I've made
-   Import and enrich strava profile export of activities (manual, no UI for this)
-   An Heatmap of all activities (very slow so far, just a prototype)

üèóÔ∏è All of this is still WIP, Website will be released soon üèóÔ∏è
